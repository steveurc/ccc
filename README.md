# ccc

The CCC challenge Rails controllers are embedded in a proprietary dynamic routing scheme that breaks up the Rails monolith. It is trivial to add the controller code to a base Rails application.

To test live versions of thise code going to https://faxo.com and using the following endpoints:

Challenge 1:

/api/v1/ccc/github_followers?name=octocat

Challenge 2:

/api/v1/ccc/github_repos_and_gazers?name=octocat

The links have purposely not been full pathed to prevent crawlers
